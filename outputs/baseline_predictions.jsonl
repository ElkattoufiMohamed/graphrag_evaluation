It works similarly to NetVLAD but introduces \"Ghost clusters\" alongside the regular NetVLAD clusters. The number of these ghost clusters (G) is typically set between 2-4 and are used to capture noisy or irrelevant content that would otherwise affect the feature aggregation process.\n\nIn GhostVLAD, both normal cluster centers and ghost cluster centers are computed during the V matrix calculation stage. However, only the vectors corresponding to the normal clusters are included in the final feature concatenation step. This means that when aggregating features, the contribution of noisy or unwanted content is minimized because it is assigned less weight due to its inclusion in the ghost clusters.\n\nThe GhostVLAD approach was used in a language identification task for Indian languages and demonstrated superior performance compared to other methods like i-vector+svm and TDNN+stat-pool. It achieved an F1-score improvement of 1.88% over the state-of-the-art x-vector system [7].\n\nIn summary, GhostVLAD enhances feature aggregation by incorporating ghost clusters that help filter out noise, leading to better language identification performance.", "retrieved": [{"doc_id": "db6c4d611b78c840972b57ee0b245003566b982feaff1084", "chunk_id": "qasper-doc1-chunk6", "score": 0.640308, "text_preview": "to the cluster $c_k$, whereas the second term corresponds to the residual term which tells how far the input descriptor $x_i$ is from the cluster center $c_k$.

This is different from single-Gaussian models like w2g and mixture-of-Gaussians models like w2gm, which use the expected likelihood kernel.\n\n2. **Objective Function**: The GM_KL approach uses a max-margin objective based on asymmetric KL divergence to capture textual entailment relations. This addresses limitations of energy-based approaches that fail to consider asymmetry in word relationships.\n\n3. **Initialization and Training**: Word embeddings are initialized using a uniform distribution, which is different from initializing with pre-trained models like BERT or ELMo. The training process uses mini-batch gradient descent with Adagrad optimizer, setting the initial learning rate to 0.05.\n\n4. **Regularization and Diversity**: The approach aims to promote diversity in learning word senses by minimizing a regularization term that encourages different contexts for each sense of a word.\n\nIn contrast, other approaches like BIBREF9 (w2g) and BIBREF10 (w2gm) use simpler models with single or mixture Gaussian distributions without the complexity of capturing textual entailment. Pre-trained embeddings such as Google News embeddings, Facebook embeddings, and retrofitted embeddings from BIBREF16 are used in other contexts but do not employ the GM_KL model's specific objective function.\n\nOverall, while pre-trained word embeddings like those from Google or Facebook can provide strong initial representations, the GM_KL approach offers a more nuanced modeling of polysemy by explicitly capturing textual entailment and promoting diversity.", "retrieved": [{"doc_id": "5f00d4f6e62f4b99484eb78491f803f8143cc1b13ad33816", "chunk_id": "qasper-doc8-chunk5", "score": 0.633467, "text_preview": "word.
